                Mortgage</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Mortgage departments of commercial banks provide loans secured by real estate. The bank
                    interest is the fee for the period of using the loan. As a rule, short-term loans (up to 5 years)
                    are
                    issued at a higher interest rate than long-term loans. If the borrower does not repay the loan, the
                    bank
                    has the right to realize the collateral, that is, sell the apartment.</p>

                <p>Mortgage banks accept only residential real estate as collateral and record the collateral only in
                    the
                    amount of the loan issued. In addition to bank loans, mortgage banks also provide preferential
                    government loans.</p>

                <p>Additional bank loans can be linked to the consumer price index, prime or dollar. Loans linked to the
                    shekel are divided according to the method of calculating the monthly payment.</p>

                <p>The repayment table is based on the so-called Spitzer formula, according to which the amount of the
                    payment - in the absence of inflation - remains unchanged, so the first payment is equal to all
                    the subsequent ones. But in practice, to avoid the depreciation of the issued loan taking into
                    account
                    inflation, the bank attaches both the monthly payment and the remaining fund to the consumer price
                    index, i.e. they both increase by the amount of the index. Spitzer loans are issued at a fixed or
                    variable interest rate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fixed interest rate is set for the entire term of the loan and does not change over time,
                        which is advantageous if you have managed to achieve a relatively low interest rate. The
                        disadvantage of such loans is the possibility of a penalty for early repayment.</li>

                    <li>A variable interest rate is set for a certain period and then changes according to the rules
                        established by the bank. The interest rate in such loans does not change arbitrarily, but
                        according to the decision of an independent organization appointed by the Bank of Israel.</li>

                    <li>A bullet is a loan that provides for monthly payments of only the interest, and the repayment of
                        the fund attached to the consumer price index is made at the end of the loan term or at any
                        time. The advantage of such a loan is relatively low monthly payments and the possibility of
                        early repayment without a penalty. Disadvantages - unpredictable inflationary growth of the fund
                        and, as a rule, a low percentage of financing - no more than 40% of the cost of the apartment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Full or partial grace - types of bullet, allowing to temporarily ease the repayment of a loan at
                        a constant interest rate. Full grace provides a deferment of monthly payments for an agreed
                        period (usually up to 3 years from the date of taking out the loan), partial grace allows only
                        interest to be paid during a certain period. Both options lead to a significant increase in
                        payments at the end of the deferment period.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Loans attached to prime are of two types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“equal fund” - in this case, the payment of the fund share is constant, and the interest share decreases. Thus, the first payment is maximum, and each subsequent one is less than the previous one.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mortgage departments of commercial banks provide loans secured by real estate. The bank interest is the fee for the period of using the loan. As a rule, short-term loans (up to 5 years) are issued at a higher interest rate than long-term loans. If the borrower does not repay the loan, the bank has the right to realize the collateral, that is, sell the apartment.</li>
